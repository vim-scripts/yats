Yet Another TypeScript Syntax file for Vim, adapted from YAJS. Key differences:

Exuberant Highlighting. The most elaborate or byzatine syntax highlighting for TypeScript.
Bundled with snippets for UltiSnips!
Builtin Support for tagbar!
Use 'typescript' as group name's prefix, not 'typeScript' nor 'TypeScript'. Works great with SyntaxComplete.
Inherit Web API and DOM keywords from YAJS
Syntax fold. Fold long code block, semantically!
Remove old, unused syntax definitions.
